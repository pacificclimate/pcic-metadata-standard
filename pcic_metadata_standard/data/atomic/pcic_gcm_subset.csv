PCIC subset of CMIP5 GCM metadata
experiment,PCIC/CMIP5,M,"String providing a title for the experiment, as specified in the controlled vocabulary.
Note: This is not the same as the CORDEX attribute driving_experiment. This definition follows CMIP5 standard."
experiment_id,PCIC/CMIP5,M,"Short string identifying the experiment, as specified in the controlled vocabulary."
forcing,PCIC/CMIP5,O,"String containing a list of the “forcing” agents that should cause the climate to change in the experiment.
Optional because the information in it is only sometimes interesting, and is often duplicated by driving_experiment."
frequency,PCIC/CMIP5,O,"String indicating the interval between individual time-samples in the atomic dataset. Fixed set of valid values; see standard.
Include only if different from frequency."
initialization_method,PCIC/CMIP5,M,"Integer (≥1) referring to the initialization method used or different observational datasets used to initialize.
Contributes to rip ensemble member code."
institute_id,PCIC/CMIP5,M,Short acronym denoting the “institution”.
institution,PCIC/CMIP5,M,String identifying in long form the institution that generated the data.
model_id,PCIC/CORDEX/ CMIP5,M,String containing an acronym that identifies the model used to generate the output
physics_version,PCIC/CMIP5,M,"Integer (≥1) referring to the physics version used by the model.
Contributes to rip ensemble member code."
realization,PCIC/CMIP5,M,"Integer (≥1) distinguishing among members of an ensemble of simulations (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc.).
Contributes to rip ensemble member code."
tracking_id,PCIC/CMIP5,O,"Tracking id of driving file.
If tracking_id is present in driving file, set this attribute to it. Otherwise, don't set this attribute."
