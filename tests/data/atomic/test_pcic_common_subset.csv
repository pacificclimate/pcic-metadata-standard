Common to all PCIC data files (test version)
contact,CMIP5,M,Name and contact information of person who can provide more information about the data.
Conventions,CMIP5,M, = 'CF-1.4'
creation_date,CMIP5,M,"String representation of the date when the file was created in the (ISO-8601) format: 
YYYY-MM-DD-THH:MM:SSZ"
domain,PCIC,O,"String identifying the geographic domain of the data in this file. E.g., “Columbia River”, “Canada”. This may be different from the domain of the data that was used as input."
frequency,PCIC/ CMIP5,M,"String indicating the interval between individual time-samples in the atomic dataset.
The standard defines a fixed set of valid values.
To the standard we add the following allowable values. For details see the section
- 'msaClim': monthly, seasonal and annual climatology
- 'saClim': seasonal and annual climatology
- 'aClim': annual climatology
- 'sClim': seasonal climatology
- 'mClim': monthly climatology"
institute_id,CMIP5,M,"Short acronym denoting the institution.
 = 'PCIC'
cf. GCM__institute_id, target__institute_id, etc."
institution,CMIP5,M,"String identifying in long form the institution that generated the data.
Suggested value: ‘PCIC (Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada)’
cf. driving_institution, target_institution, etc."
modeling_realm,CMIP5,M,"String that indicates the high level modeling component which is particularly relevant. E.g., “atmos”.
Presumably the same as the driving modeling_realm, but also a valid descriptor of downscaled and modelled data, therefore retained as a base-level attribute."
product,CMIP5,M,"Possible values:
- ‘output’ for GCM output (CMIP5 standard value)
- ‘downscaled output’ for downscaling output (PCIC-defined value)
- 'hydrological model output' for hydrological model output (PCIC-defined value)
- ‘streamflow model output’ for streamflow model output (PCIC-defined value)
- ‘CLIMDEX output’ for CLIMDEX indices (PCIC-defined value)"
project_id,CMIP5,M," = 'CMIP5' for CMIP5. 
Evidently (according to some code we have) = 'CMIP3' for CMIP3. 
Should take its value from the driving project_id. Retained at base level because it is a valid (and very important) descriptor of downscaled data."
table_id,CMIP5,M,"String identifying the CMIP5 Requested Output table where this variable appears. See Supplementary information below.
Supports filename generation."
title,CF,M,A succinct description of what is in this file.
tracking_id,CMIP5,O,"A universally unique string that identifies this file, generated by a standard 3rd party utility, OSSP uuid, version 4 (random number based).
Not necessarily useful in PCIC generated files, therefore optional."
